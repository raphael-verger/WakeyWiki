# Wakey Wiki
## Project Overview
* Collaborated in a team of three for the 12th edition of the 12th edition of the CodeJam() Hackathon with over 300 participants to create an application aiming at preventing drivers from falling asleep
* Applied our knowledge of OpenCV and Dlib (Python libraries) to use facial recognition to track the userâ€™s eyes and detect blinking
* Integrated voice recognition to our system to interact with the driver
* Earned the 3rd place of the challenge

## Demo
* Link to a quick demo:

* PS: We can't hear the audio recordings on the video (the laptops does not record the sounds it emits). When the driver falls asleep, an alarm rings and a voice reminds the user to take breaks regularly.


## Configuration
* You will need to import add shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat (file too heavy)
